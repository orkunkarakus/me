# Introduction

While developing on React Native, i noticed the lack of a QR library. 
All of the existing libraries were working in the JS Worklet, none of them were native. Therefore on js side all libraries are inefficent and buggy too. 
I decided to write a native based library on the IOS and ANDROID side for performant and qualitified apps.

# Features

- Native code based
- Write with Objective-C and Kotlin
- New Architecture support
- Base64 based png export
- IOS/ANDROID supported
